# DAEN328-Final-Project
The objective of this project is to create a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using a real-world API. 
This project simulates a data engineering pipeline, handling, and processing live data. We chose to use the Chicago Food Inspections dataset provided by the City of Chicago and the Chicago Data Portal, which updates daily.We chose this data because the data is accessible, meaningful, and high-volume meaning we had lots of data to work with. The API we used was the O data or the Open Data Protocol.
