# DAEN328-Final-Project
The objective of this project is to create a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using a real-world API. 
This project simulates a data engineering pipeline, handling, and processing live data. We chose to use the Chicago Food Inspections dataset provided by the City of Chicago and the Chicago Data Portal, which updates daily.We chose this data because the data is accessible, meaningful, and high-volume meaning we had lots of data to work with. The API we used was the O data or the Open Data Protocol.

Sydney Flake - Dockerized, helped clean the data, worked on the presentation, and set up the Streamlit.
Jade Winebright - Cleaned the data, made the presentation, and made the categorial feature dictionaries.
Vedh Jaishankar - Made all visualizations for Streamlit. 
Manaswi Luitel - Cleaned the data, worked on the read me file, and made the presentation.
